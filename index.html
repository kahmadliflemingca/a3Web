  <h3>We strive</h3>

  <h3>We can't be beat</h3>
  <p>Our consulting firm has never had a negative client review. Our team has won the "Most Improved GIS" award 5 years in a row, we have been on the cover page
    of the "Eccentric Performer" 3 years in a row, and have held the "Wolf of GIS" title 2 years standing. We have maps displayed in digital museums across the country. 
    Our near perfect database creations have made Chuck Norris cry.</p>
